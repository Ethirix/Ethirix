# Hello, I'm Jack

I come from a C# background, moving onto studying C++ in university for low level development and optimisation
for real time applications. I’m quick to pick up new skills and have a strong grasp of programming fundamentals
which I hope I can apply to new skill sets within a team which will help me develop my programming abilities
further. Additionally, I am on the autism spectrum – neurodivergent.

I have graduated with a BSc (Hons) Computer Games Programming (First Class Honours) at the University of Staffordshire.

## Active Projects
### Volcanus Lucis
[libvlengine](https://github.com/VolcanusLucis/libvlengine) - A graphical engine built majoritively from scratch using Vulkan and
other `libvl-` libraries built for it.

[libvlmath](https://github.com/VolcanusLucis/libvlmath) - A Linear Algebra Library to suppliment [libvlengine](https://github.com/VolcanusLucis/libvlengine). 
Can be used standalone too, featuring matrix and vector mathematics as well as SIMD intrinsics. 

### Other Projects
[Connect Four Remake](https://github.com/Ethirix/connect-four-remake) - A remake of an old project I made in C# WPF. 
This version will use Avalonia and use the ~5 years of experience I've gained since.

[libswm](https://github.com/Ethirix/libswm) - an attempt at making (old-school) windows C++ programming easier.
This project is mostly just for fun and to learn about Application-Binary Interfaces (ABI) and .DLL programming.
