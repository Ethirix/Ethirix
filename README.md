# Hello, I'm Jack

I picked up C# in College and that founded my understanding of Programming. From there I started to learn C++ to become a bit more language-agnostic.
I hope in the future, after my journey though University to work in the Games Industry as either a Tools or Engine Programmer.

I'm at Staffordshire University, studying Computer Games Programming BSc (Hons).

## Active Projects
[Connect Four Remake](https://github.com/Ethirix/connect-four-remake) - A remake of an old project I made in C# WPF. 
This version will use Avalonia and use the ~5 years of experience I've gained since.

[libswm](https://github.com/Ethirix/libswm) - an attempt at making (old-school) windows C++ programming easier.
This project is mostly just for fun and to learn about Application-Binary Interfaces (ABI) and .DLL programming.
