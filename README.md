# Hello, I'm Jack

I picked up C# in College and that founded my understanding of Programming. From there I started to learn C++ to become a bit more language-agnostic.
I hope in the future, after my journey though University to work in the Games Industry as either a Tools or Engine Programmer.

I'm at Staffordshire University, studying Computer Games Programming BSc (Hons).
